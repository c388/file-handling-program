DESCRIPTION: I HAVE DONE MY TASKS BY TAKING REFERENCES FROM CHATGPT,GOOGLE,GOOGLE GEMINI AND PERFROM TASKS ON DEV C++.This repository contains a complete File Handling Program written in C, developed to demonstrate how files can be created, read, written, and updated using the C programming language. File handling is one of the most important concepts in programming because it allows data to be stored permanently and accessed whenever required. This project focuses on implementing file operations in a simple, easy-to-understand way so that beginners can clearly grasp how files work in C.
